    <h1>About AniLens</h1>
    <p>
      AniLens is an anime scene identification tool built to answer a simple
      but common question:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>“Which anime is this scene from?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a screenshot or image URL, AniLens identifies the most likely
      anime, episode, and exact scene where the image appears.
    </p>

    <h2>How AniLens Works</h2>
    <p>
      AniLens analyzes the visual content of an image and searches for matching
      anime scenes using the <strong>trace.moe</strong> API.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a match is found, additional information such as anime titles
      (Romaji and English), episode number, and preview media are retrieved
      using <strong>AniList</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each result includes a confidence score, helping users understand how
      closely the image matches the detected scene.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>
      AniLens was built by <strong>Ashlesh</strong> as a practical exploration
      into backend-driven web applications and API-based systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project focuses on clean data flow, clear server-side logic,
      and reliable integration with external services, rather than heavy
      frontend frameworks or visual complexity.
